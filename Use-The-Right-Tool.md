# Why You Should Always Use The Right Tool For Your Project
----

While working on your data project, do not use a tool because of its popularity, but because you know your way around it, and it can help you deliver the expected results effectively and efficiently.


Take a look at SQL and Excel, two different tools that you can use to solve the same problem.

**Excel**: This is where you can perform data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization, and get insights quickly.

**SQL**: This is where you can perform data cleaning and get preliminary insights from your data, but it requires an external tool to perform data visualization.
