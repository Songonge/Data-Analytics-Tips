# Where Do You Get Datasets For Your Personal Projects?
----

## Introduction
You want to practice data cleaning, but do not have the right dataset? 

You can use AI, for example, **ChatGPT**, to generate custom datasets tailored for data cleaning practice. 

## Why use AI-Generated Datasets for Data Cleaning Practice?
Here is what to consider while using AI-generated data to practice your data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills:  
* You can instantly create datasets with missing values, duplicates, typos, and formatting issues.
* This is perfect for simulating real-world data challenges.
* AI-generated data is cost-effective, fast, and avoids privacy concerns, since no real personal information is involved.

> [!NOTE]
> :large_blue_circle: You can customize the complexity and structure of your dataset, making it easy to target specific cleaning techniques, scenarios, or industries.


### A. Advantages of using AI-Generated Dataset
* **Privacy & Security**  
  * No sensitive or confidential data is used, so you can practice safely.  
* **Efficiency**  
  * Quickly generate diverse datasets for repeated practice or training.  
* **Customization**  
  * Tailor datasets to focus on specific data cleaning skills, fields, industries, etc.

### B. Disadvantages of using AI-Generated Dataset
* **Lack of Realism**  
  * AI-generated data may not capture all the odds and complexities of real-world data, potentially missing rare edge cases.  
* **Bias & Distribution**  
  * If not carefully generated, the data can introduce biases or unrealistic patterns, which may not fully prepare you for real data cleaning challenges.  
* **Overfitting to Patterns**  
  * Practicing only on AI-generated data could lead to overfitting your skills to artificial scenarios. So it is best to supplement your learning with real datasets when possible.
