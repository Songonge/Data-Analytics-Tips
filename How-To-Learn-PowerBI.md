# The Best Way To Learn Power BI

Here I am sharing some tips based on my **Power BI** learning journey.

1. First, understand how the Power BI interface works. Try clicking around to see the different menus.

2. Work on small, simple, and already cleaned datasets to get familiar with the tool. Then, experiment with simple visualizations like bar charts and tables

3. Watch videos on YouTube, as there are very good channels there that provide good content. Google and read a lot to understand the concepts.

4. Explore platforms that offer online courses, such as:  
   * DataCamp
   * Coursera
   * 365 Data Science
   * Udemy, etc.

5. Learn Power Query for Data Cleaning. If you already have some good knowledge of Excel, you should know how to work with Power Query. It is the same in Power BI. Take a messy dataset, clean it up in Power Query, and load it into Power BI to proceed with the analysis.
   * Take a messy dataset
   * Clean it up in Power Query
   * Load it into Power BI to proceed with the analysis.

6. Understand the relationships between tables and data modeling. A strong data model is the backbone of a good Power BI report. Many reports fail to deliver good insights because of wrong data modeling.

7. Learn DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures. Start with basic measures just as you would with Excel. Then, use it in your visuals. After that, move to intermediate measures.

8. Build dashboards as you learn. Start with static dashboards and then add interactivity with slicers, filters, etc. 

9. Practice with projects. This will help you master the concept faster. 
   * Challenge yourself often by going the extra mile.
   * Seek feedback whenever possible from people ahead of you.

10. Join challenges to boost your knowledge and confidence. 
    * You can find most of them on LinkedIn.

11. Stop comparing yourself to others. They all started like you. Just put in the work, and very soon, you will also be an expert.
