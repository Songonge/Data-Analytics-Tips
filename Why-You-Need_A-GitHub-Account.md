# Why DO You Need A GitHub Account?

Those in a tech field who do not have a GitHub account!

Let me tell you something.

In today's competitive tech landscape, your GitHub account/profile isn't just a repository. It is your professional showcase. You can even see it as your career passport.


Here is why GitHub is essential:  

* **A bank of all your projects**
  * A GitHub account helps you keep all your projects in one place. These projects' timeline your journey from learning to mastering frameworks.

* **Showcase your skills**
  * A GitHub account is like a portfolio. Recruiters and hiring managers often check it out to see your coding style, problem-solving approach, and contributions.

* **Collaboration**
  * GitHub helps you contribute to projects and connect with other people. This helps you learn, network, and make a real-world impact. Moreover, people can follow you there just as they do here on LinkedIn and stay up-to-date with your projects.

* **Build credibility**
  * When you properly maintain your GitHub profile, it shows that you are not just a learner, but you are a doer. In addition, it speaks about your passion for tech and your commitment to growth.

* **Easy to share**
  * With just one link to your profile, people can see all the projects you have worked on or collaborated on. Moreover, you can include the link on your CV or Resume.
