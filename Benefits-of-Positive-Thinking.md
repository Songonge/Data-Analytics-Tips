# The Benefits of Positive Thinking

Did you know that the thoughts you feed your mind can greatly influence your behavior and what you’re able to achieve, both positively and negatively?

For example, positive thinking can help you manage stress, improve your health, and build resilience.

This doesn’t mean ignoring challenges or negative emotions. Instead, it’s about approaching difficulties with a positive and constructive mindset.

Here is a personal example.

Recently, I’ve been searching for a new job and have applied to many positions. Nearly every day, I receive emails saying things like, “We have decided to move forward with another candidate. We’ll keep your application on file and contact you if something comes up.”
Instead of letting this discouraging news get me down, 

* I choose to feed my mind with positive thoughts such as “I can do this,” and “I will succeed.”  
* I focus on what I can do differently next time.  
* I see every rejection as a redirection.  
* I believe in my potential and remind myself that, no matter how many “no’s” I receive, it only takes one “yes” to change everything.  

This is the power of positive thinking. It helps me look forward to what comes next instead of focusing on the past.

To help you get started, I’ve prepared the list below of 30 positive affirmations that can help shift your mindset in the right direction.
