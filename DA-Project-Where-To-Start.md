Below is a step-by-step breakdown of key tasks to complete on a data analytics project.

### 1. Define The Project Objectives and Deliverables
* Identify the key questions or goals  
Why?  
* A clear goal directs what data you need and how you will analyze it.
 
### 2. Understand the Structure of your Tables
* Examine each table's schema: columns, data types, relationships, and keys.  
Why? This is helpful before any meaningful combination or analysis. Note: Most of the time, your project's data is located in different tables.
 
### 3. Prepare and Clean the Data
* Handle missing values
* Remove duplicates
* Fix formatting issues
* Ensure consistent units/currency/date formats
Why? Data cleaning is often the most time-consuming part, but it is essential for ensuring accuracy and reliability in your analysis.

### 4. Combine/Merge the Tables
* Use keys or common fields to combine tables  
Why?  
* It creates a complete dataset by bringing together relevant information from all the tables. It improves data quality and ensures that the analysis is comprehensive.

### 5. Data Enrichment (Optional)
* Create new variables or derive new metrics
* Create a date table using the date column from your table  
Why?  
* It provides additional context and improves the power of your analysis by revealing deeper insights.

### 6. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Run summary statistics
* Explore patterns, trends, and anomalies in your dataset  
Why?  
* EDA helps you uncover patterns, spot errors, and decide which variables matter for analysis. 

### 7. Perform Analysis
* Compare trends across time, regions, or segments
* Apply analytical techniques to answer initially defined questions
* Build KPIs  
Why?  
* Here, you extract actionable insights from your prepared dataset and test hypotheses, directly addressing your projectâ€™s objectives.

### 8. Visualize Results
* Create different charts
* Use any visualization tool  
Why?  
* It helps stakeholders understand results more easily through clear visuals.

### 9. Interpret and Report your Results
* Tell the story behind the data to communicate findings through reports or presentations tailored to your audience
* Explain what the analysis reveals, what it means, and why it matters
* Use concise reports, presentations, or dashboards  
Why?  
* It converts technical output into business-relevant insights. This helps stakeholders make informed decisions based on your analysis.

### 10. Make Data-Driven Recommendations
* Validate your findings by checking for errors, testing assumptions, and possibly seeking feedback from others
* Suggest actions to be taken  
Why?  
* Validation ensures the credibility and robustness of your conclusions before they are used in decision-making.

### 11. Monitor & Iterate
* Evaluate the impact of implemented changes
* Re-analyze periodically
* Update data pipelines or dashboards as needed  
Why?  
* It ensures your analysis stays useful and responsive to changes.
