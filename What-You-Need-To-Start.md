# What You Need To Start A Data Career

## Introduction
You do not need an IT background or a CS degree to break into data analytics.  
My journey into data analytics didn’t start with a tech background. 


## How I Started
Back then, I only had degrees:  
* Physics
* Mathematics
* Engineering
* NOT Computer Science  

During my research, while completing all my degrees, I analyzed data, created visuals, and interpreted the findings. But then, I was using tools like:  
* **FORTRAN**: I wrote programs to generate data from modeling.
* **MATLAB**: I wrote programs and used the data generated in FORTRAN to create visuals.
* **FEA**: I used Finite Element Analysis in ABAQUS to model beams and plates, and created visuals from the data generated.
* **Excel**: I used Excel to build quick visuals and to manage student grades.  

You see, I was already working with data and creating visuals to communicate insights. Was I a Data Analyst? NO! I was a student, researcher, and teaching assistant.  

So, when I decided to break into data analytics, I doubted myself and kept thinking,  
* Do I belong in this space?
* What if I do not understand the tools?
* What if it is a wrong choice?  

One day, I eventually decided to start. I did not have a roadmap, and I did not have a mentor.  
I took online courses, jumped from one tool to another, and got certificates.  
Was that enough? NO! I was doing everything wrong! 


## What Happened Next?
After several months, I took a step back and reevaluated my progress and realized that I could not talk about my skills in one tool with confidence.

That is when I started all over again, but this time with a clear roadmap.  
* I learned one tool at a time.
* I practiced with real datasets.
* I worked on projects.
* I documented my projects on my GitHub.
* I shared my knowledge along the way.
* I also built my portfolio as a personalized website, and today, I am proud of all my achievements.  

Now, this is what I can do.  
* Clean complex and messy data.
* Analyze data and build interactive dashboards that communicate insights at first glance.
* Tell meaningful stories with numbers.
* Help businesses make informed decisions based on insights from data.
* Work in a team and communicate clearly.
* Train other people in data analytics tools.
* I am still learning because growth never stops.


## Why am I sharing this with you?
Look at me. Today,  
* I confidently use tools like **Power BI**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and more to solve real-life problems as a Data Analyst.
* I communicate clearly with others to share my knowledge, help businesses make informed decisions based on data.  

Not because I had it all figured out, but because I kept going even during hard times. If you are starting,  
* Don’t aim for perfection.
* Aim for consistency.
* Reach out to people ahead of you and seek advice.

## What You Should Do
Your degree or background shouldn’t limit what you can become or stop you from breaking into Data Analytics. What matters is your willingness to learn, unlearn, and grow.   
If you are still asking, “Can I excel in data analytics?” you are asking the wrong question. Your path doesn't need to look like everyone else's. If I were able to do this, so can you, and even better.  

Here are the questions you should be asking:  
* Which area do I need to specialize in? Data Analyst, Data Science, Data Engineering, etc. 
* Where do I start? Online course, bootcamp, etc. 
* What tool do I need to learn first? This will depend on the area you choose. For a Data Analyst, I would propose Excel, but for Data Science, start with Python.  

When you are done answering the above questions,  
* Design a clear roadmap to follow.
* Seek a mentor's guidance, if necessary.
* Find someone who is already working in the field and ask for advice.

That is it!
