# What To Include In Your Data Analysis Report
----

## Background
Ever wondered what should go into your data analysis report? 

It is not just about crunching numbers but uncovering insights and proposing recommendations that drive business decisions.

Here is a sneak peek into how I approach my tasks, which you can adapt to your liking. 

## Planning & Goal Setting
Before diving into the data, I do the following:  
* Outline the business question(s)
* Define the project's key objectives
* Break down tasks into manageable steps. 
> [!Note]
> A clear roadmap keeps me focused and on track.


## Data Exploration & Cleaning
Data is rarely perfect. So, I spend a good amount of time cleaning and preparing datasets. My go-to tools are:
-> SQL (PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, or MySQL)
-> Excel 
-> Power Query
> [!Note]
> A good analysis starts with clean data. Messier data will produce a wrong analysis.


## Analysis & Insights
Using tools like SQL, Excel, or Power Query, I dig deep to find patterns and trends that help answer critical questions.

> This gives me the idea of visuals to use to tell my story.


## Visualization & Storytelling
Numbers alone do not tell the whole story. So, I take time to visualize the data in meaningful ways and build interactive dashboards to help stakeholders make informed decisions.
> [!Note]
> Properly choosing charts communicates the story better than words.


## Insights and Recommendations
This part is very crucial for me as it is where I highlight what I found during my analysis. Additionally, I list trends, patterns, and opportunities that can lead to actionable business decisions and help businesses grow.
> [!Note]
> This is the place where your stakeholders and audience wait to see what you propose.


> [!IMPORTANT]

> :purple_circle: With data evolving every day, I stay updated with new techniques and best practices to refine my approach.
