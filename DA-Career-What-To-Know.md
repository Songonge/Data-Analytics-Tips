# What You Should Know About A DA Career
When I started, I wished I had a clear roadmap. Instead, I spent time figuring out what skills to learn, which tools to focus on, and how to gain real-world experience. 

Looking back, here’s what I would tell my past self (and anyone just starting):  

1. **Master the fundamentals**
   * Start with Excel
   * Then, move to SQL
   * End with Power BI (or Tableau) or any BI tool.
   * These core tools will take you far.

2. **Work on real projects**
   * Theory is great, but not enough
   * Hands-on experience with datasets is what truly builds confidence.

3. **Learn to communicate insights**
   * Data storytelling is just as important as analysis.

4. **Network and share your journey**
   * Opportunities may come from the connections you build.

## What You Need to Become a Good Data Analyst
Becoming an expert data analyst requires a combination of the following:  

* **Technical Skills**
  * Learn essential tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, or Tableau. 

* **Practical Experience**
  * Work on projects and create a portfolio to showcase your work. You can host all your projects on GitHub, then add the link to your resume or your LinkedIn profile.

* **Continuous Learning**
  * Expand your skills and knowledge. This is an ongoing process of self-improvement and professional development. You do not need to be an expert in all tools, but know how you can shift from one to another if need be.

* **Effective Communication**
  * Be able to communicate technical concepts to an audience with no data background clearly and concisely so that they understand.  

By following these strategies, you will position yourself as a valuable asset in your organization and the broader data analytics community.

## The First Thing You Should Do when You Come Across Datasets

Here are some thought processes that a data analyst typically experiences upon first viewing data, emphasizing the critical aspects that guide their analytical journey. 

* Understanding the business context
