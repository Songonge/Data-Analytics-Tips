# Little Strategies to Achieve More in Life
----

In this short document, I am sharing some strategies that help me achieve a lot whether in my work life or personal life.  

## Working SMART, Not HARD, and Setting Small Achievable Goals  
Every big achievement starts with a small step. Whether youâ€™re learning a new skill, working on a passion project, or tackling a challenging goal, remember this: no matter how small progress may be, it keeps you moving forward.  

I mostly set my goals such that they are:  
* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-bound

## Being Consistent and Avoiding Being Discouraged
It is easy to feel discouraged when things donâ€™t go as planned or when we see the journey still far from the end. 

* Maybe you didnâ€™t land that job you wanted,
* Your career isnâ€™t advancing as quickly as you hoped, or
* You feel overwhelmed by learning something new.  

But let me tell you something: you are not alone. Everyone goes through it at a time in their life. Setbacks donâ€™t define you but your response to them does.  

> [!Tip]
> Here is how you can shift your thoughts:  
> * Think of rejections as redirections.
> * Take failures as opportunities to learn.
> * Picture little progress as a foundation for something big.
> * See other people's success as motivation.

Showing up every day, not only when I feel like it, and doing the little I can do. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwigesongong/) is an example.

## Being Myself
* Because everybody is already taken. I know I have something specific in me and a lot to offer. That is why I always offer to help whenever the opportunity arises. Plus, I do not compare myself to others.
* I also take care of myself and I am kind to myself. These help me be full of energy to take care of others.

## Leaving My Comfort Zone
This is what helps me face challenges and grow. In addition, I get exposed to people in my field who may help and guide me on my way. 

## Surrounding myself with positivity
* I constantly seek out uplifting people and thoughts to fuel my energy. 
* I practice gratitude by writing down three to five things I am thankful for every morning.  

Every successful person you admire once felt like giving up. The difference is, if they did, you wouldn't have anything to admire in them. They pushed through, learned from their struggles, and came out stronger.

In the same way, you should keep going so that tomorrow, other people can admire you. You are closer to your goals than you think.

> * Your journey is yours alone.
> * Comparisons are unnecessary. So, focus on your growth.
> * Your persistence will pay off, and your story will inspire others.
> * You have got this!
