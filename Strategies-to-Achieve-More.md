# Little Strategies to Achieve More in Life

In this short document, I am sharing some strategies that help me achieve a lot whether in my work life or personal life.  

## Working SMART, Not HARD
* **Set small achievable goals**  
Every big achievement starts with a small step. Whether youâ€™re learning a new skill, working on a passion project, or tackling a challenging goal, remember this: no matter how small progress may be, it keeps you moving forward.
I always set my goals such that they are:
* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-bound

## Being Consistent
Showing up every day, not only when I feel like it, and doing the little I can do. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwigesongong/) is an example.

## Being Myself
* Because everybody is already taken. I know I have something specific in me and a lot to offer. That is why I always offer to help whenever the opportunity arises. Plus, I do not compare myself to others.
* I also take care of myself and I am kind to myself. These help me be full of energy to take care of others.

## Leaving My Comfort Zone
This is what helps me face challenges and grow. In addition, I get exposed to people in my field who may help and guide me on my way. 

## Surrounding myself with positivity
* I constantly seek out uplifting people and thoughts to fuel my energy. 
* I Practice gratitude by writing down three to five things I am thankful for every morning.


And you, what is your strategy to achieve more?
