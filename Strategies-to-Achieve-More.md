# Little Strategies to Achieve More in Life
----

In this short document, I am sharing some strategies that help me achieve a lot whether in my work life or personal life.  

## Working SMART, Not HARD

### :dart: Setting Small Achievable Goals  
Every big achievement starts with a small step. Whether youâ€™re learning a new skill, working on a passion project, or tackling a challenging goal, remember this: no matter how small progress may be, it keeps you moving forward.  
* I define what success looks like for me. This is my own path. 
* I break big goals into actionable steps. This helps me avoid being overwhelmed. 
* I set my goals such that they are:  
  * Specific
  * Measurable
  * Achievable
  * Relevant
  * Time-bound

### :trophy: The Power of Starting Small and Finishing Big
As a professional, I have come to appreciate the value of small, consistent steps in achieving big goals. 

Whether it is mastering a new skill, analyzing complex data, teaching, mentoring, or preparing for a new role, my journey started with small steps.

Here are the things that help me stay motivated daily:  
* Waking up every morning with a plan for the day: This is crucial for me as it sets the tone for productivity.
* Taking intermittent breaks when I work: Every break for me is a time to refresh and recharge my energy.
* Allocating time for each task: This is my way of staying in control of my schedule.
* Staying up to date with the trends: The tech field evolves very fast, and it is up to you and me to adapt to the new features.
* Celebrating small wins: Even if sometimes I do not finish what I have on my daily list, I celebrate what I achieved and highlight what is left. Besides, I can still continue the following day.
* Believing in myself: As someone who comes from a non-tech background, the journey has not been easy. Every challenge has been an opportunity for me to grow, prove my resilience, and a stepping stone towards becoming the best version of myself. 

## Being Consistent and Avoiding Being Discouraged
It is easy to feel discouraged when things donâ€™t go as planned or when we see the journey still far from the end. 

* Maybe you didnâ€™t land that job you wanted,
* Your career isnâ€™t advancing as quickly as you hoped, or
* You feel overwhelmed by learning something new.  

But let me tell you something: you are not alone. Everyone goes through it at a time in their life. Setbacks donâ€™t define you but your response to them does.

> :green_circle: Take failures as opportunities to learn.  
> :green_circle: Picture little progress as a foundation for something big.  
> ğŸŸ¢ See other people's success as motivation.

* Showing up every day, not only when I feel like it, and doing the little I can do. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwigesongong/) is an example.  

* **Prioritizing Smartly** 
  * I focus on the most important tasks and those with close deadlines. 
  * I avoid burnout by working efficiently, not just endlessly.

* **Staying Consistent** 
  * Small daily efforts lead to big results. Someone will say that $1 is the foundation of $1000 and more.
  * I keep showing up, even when not motivated. We do not have the same engagement every day, but we should try to push ourselves.


## Being Myself
* Because everybody is already taken. I know I have something specific in me and a lot to offer. That is why I always offer to help whenever the opportunity arises. Plus, I do not compare myself to others.
* I also take care of myself and I am kind to myself. These help me be full of energy to take care of others.
* I network with good intentions


## Leaving My Comfort Zone
This is what helps me face challenges and grow. In addition, I get exposed to people in my field who may help and guide me on my way.  
  * I engage with people who inspire and challenge me. They help me get out of my comfort zone.
  * One conversation can change everything. So, I am not afraid to be the one starting the conversation.

## Surrounding Myself with Positivity
* I constantly seek out uplifting people and thoughts to fuel my energy. 
* I practice gratitude by writing down three to five things I am thankful for every morning.
* I celebrate progress
  * I acknowledge every win with gratitude, no matter how small.
  * Each progress, not perfection, is the key. This is what keeps me going.  

Every successful person you admire once felt like giving up. The difference is, if they did, you wouldn't have anything to admire in them. They pushed through, learned from their struggles, and came out stronger.

In the same way, you should keep going so that tomorrow, other people can admire you. You are closer to your goals than you think.
